# BigFish Hotel Menu

Welcome to the **BigFish Hotel Menu** project â€” a simple, elegant HTML-based menu layout for a fictional hotel restaurant. This project showcases a categorized food menu with styling hooks for special and spicy items.

## Project Overview

This is a static HTML page that displays a restaurant menu divided into three sections:

- **Starters**
- **Main Dishes**
- **Desserts**

Each menu item includes:

- A title
- A short description
- A price
- Optional styling classes (`special`, `spicy`) for visual emphasis

## Features

- Responsive layout using `<meta viewport>` for mobile compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Menu items organized in a grid layout
- Special tags:
  - `.special` class for featured dishes
  - `.spicy` class for spicy items (e.g., ðŸŒ¶ emoji included)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Customize `styles.css` to match your branding or design preferences.

## Customization Tips

- Add more categories by duplicating the `<section>` structure.
- Enhance interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., filtering by category or price).
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and alt text if images are added.
